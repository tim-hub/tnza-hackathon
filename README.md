# TVNZ Hackathon

This is a project for the Robert Walter 2018 Hackathon. **The TVNZ contents of TV On Demand problem.**

This hackathon is a NZ's locol hackathons for graduates and students. This is coding part of our solution for the problem.

## Basic Structure
All core codes are in the ipython notebook.  This is also a flask web application.

The data in data set is from TVNZ website, there are also fake data in it.

For a data science or a developer, the ipython notebook is enough to understand the processing. For who does not good at programming, the flask web application might be better. In my opinion, ipython notebook is more straight-forward.
